# Coding Standards & Preferences

- Always explain code and concepts in a clear, simple, and step-by-step manner.
- Use plain language and avoid jargon unless explained.
- When showing code, add comments to clarify important lines.
- Prefer concise, readable, and maintainable code.
- Use best practices for Flutter, Dart, and general programming.
- When explaining, relate concepts to real-world analogies if possible.
- If there are multiple ways to do something, mention the simplest and most common approach first.
- Assume the reader is learning deeply and wants to understand both "how" and "why."
- When asked for an explanation, always provide context and purpose, not just what the code does.

## Domain Knowledge

- Focus on Flutter, Dart, and mobile app development.
- Highlight practical tips for debugging, structuring projects, and using packages.
- When discussing architecture, prefer simple patterns (like Provider or BLoC) unless otherwise requested.

## Preferences
